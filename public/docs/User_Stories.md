# User Authentication

### Sign Up

- As an unregistered and unauthorized user
    - I want to be able to sign up for the website via a sign-up form.

- When I'm on the /signup page:
    - I would like to be able to enter my email, username, and password.
    - I would like the website to log me in once the form is successfully submitted.
    - So that I can seamlessly transition from being unregistered to using the site.
- When I enter invalid data on the sign-up form:
    - I would like the website to notify me of my failed validations.
    - I would like the form fields to repopulate with my valid entries (except for the password fields)
    - So that I can resubmit without having to fill in every field again.
